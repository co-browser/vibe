### Prerequisites

To use Vibe's Gmail integration, you need to set up Google Cloud credentials.

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project and obtain credentials

#### a. Create a Google Cloud Project:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API for your project

#### b. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
3. Choose either "Desktop app" or "Web application" as application type
4. Give it a name and click "Create"
5. For Web application, add `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback` to the authorized redirect URIs
6. Download the JSON file of your client's OAuth keys
7. Rename the key file to `gcp-oauth.keys.json`

### Step 2: Run Authentication

You can authenticate in two ways:

#### a. Global Authentication (Recommended):

```bash
# First time: Place gcp-oauth.keys.json in your home directory's .gmail-mcp folder
mkdir -p ~/.gmail-mcp
mv gcp-oauth.keys.json ~/.gmail-mcp/
```

#### b. Project-specific Authentication:

Place the `gcp-oauth.keys.json` file in your project's MCP Gmail package directory.

> [!TIP]
> 
> The global authentication method is recommended as it allows you to use the same credentials across multiple projects.
