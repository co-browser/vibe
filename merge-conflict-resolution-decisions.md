# Merge Conflict Resolution Decisions for PR #45

## Overview
This document details the decisions made while resolving merge conflicts between the local `feat/omnibox` branch and `origin/main`. The general strategy is to prefer upstream (main) changes while preserving critical local omnibox functionality.

## Conflict Resolution Log

### 1. NavigationBar.tsx
**File**: `apps/electron-app/src/renderer/src/components/layout/NavigationBar.tsx`
**Conflicts**: 
- URL validation logic (lines 691-705)
- Function naming: `generateNonHistorySuggestions` vs `generateRealSuggestions`
- Different validation approaches

**Decision**: Keep local changes as they contain the refined omnibox implementation with performance optimizations.
**Reason**: Local changes include the optimized state management and performance fixes we just implemented.

### 2. MainApp.tsx
**File**: `apps/electron-app/src/renderer/src/components/main/MainApp.tsx`
**Conflicts**:
- Import statements (useCallback added in HEAD)
- Window interface definitions
- Modal components (SettingsModal, DownloadsModal)
- Chat panel minimization state
- Health check duplicated code

**Decision**: Take upstream changes and integrate local modal functionality
**Reason**: Upstream has cleaner window interface handling, but we need to preserve modal functionality from HEAD.

### 3. tab-manager.ts
**File**: `apps/electron-app/src/main/browser/tab-manager.ts`
**Conflicts**:
- Imports (user profile store, context menu, analytics)
- Window filtering logic
- View destruction checks
- Navigation history error handling

**Decision**: Keep upstream changes with selective integration of HEAD improvements
**Reason**: Upstream has cleaner implementation, but HEAD has better error handling for navigation history.

### 4. useSearchWorker.ts
**Status**: Already resolved locally with no conflicts
**Reason**: Local changes are complete and working.

### 5. Package Files
**Files**: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `electron-builder.js`
**Decision**: Accept upstream versions
**Reason**: Upstream likely has the latest dependency updates.

### 6. Shared Types
**Files**: Various files in `packages/shared-types/`
**Decision**: Accept upstream changes
**Reason**: Type definitions should match the main branch for consistency.

### 7. Agent and MCP Files
**Files**: Various files in `packages/agent-core/`, `packages/mcp-*/`
**Decision**: Accept upstream changes
**Reason**: These are new features in main that we want to preserve.

### 8. IPC Handlers
**Files**: Various IPC handler files
**Decision**: Accept upstream changes with careful integration
**Reason**: IPC handlers need to match the main architecture.

### 9. Version Files
**Files**: `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`
**Decision**: Accept upstream changes
**Reason**: Version information should come from main.

### 10. CI/CD Files
**Files**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.gitignore`
**Decision**: Accept upstream changes
**Reason**: CI/CD configuration should match main branch.

## Testing Plan
After resolution:
1. Test omnibox functionality (focus, blur, suggestions)
2. Test navigation (back, forward, reload)
3. Test chat panel toggle
4. Test modals (settings, downloads)
5. Test tab management (create, close, sleep/wake)
6. Run TypeScript compilation
7. Run lint checks

## Rollback Plan
If issues are found:
1. Keep local NavigationBar.tsx changes (critical for omnibox)
2. Revert other files to upstream if needed
3. Document any incompatibilities found

## Post-Merge Issues Found

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
After resolving conflicts, several TypeScript errors were found:

1. **Missing imports in tab-manager.ts**: 
   - Fixed by adding missing imports from HEAD
   - Imports: useUserProfileStore, setupContextMenuHandlers, WindowBroadcast, NavigationErrorHandler, userAnalytics, DEFAULT_USER_AGENT

2. **Missing session import in browser.ts**:
   - Fixed by adding session to electron imports
   - Called setupContentSecurityPolicy in constructor

3. **Remaining issues** (to be fixed in follow-up commits):
   - ApplicationWindow missing properties (dialogManager, bluetooth callbacks)
   - Duplicate logger declarations in agent-service.ts
   - Missing DownloadItem export from shared-types
   - Various missing service imports in main/index.ts
   - Agent service interface mismatches

## Decision Summary
The merge was completed with preference for upstream changes except for:
- NavigationBar.tsx - kept local omnibox implementation
- Critical imports needed for compilation were restored

A backup branch `feat/omnibox-backup` was created before merge.
