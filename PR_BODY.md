# 🚀 Enhanced Onboarding System with 3D UI and Chrome Import

## Overview
This PR introduces a complete overhaul of the onboarding system with a modern 3D interface, streamlined Chrome password import, and improved security architecture. The new onboarding flow provides a more engaging and secure first-time user experience.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Modern 3D Onboarding Interface
- **Transparent window with vibrancy effects** - Beautiful glass-morphism design
- **React Three Fiber integration** - Smooth 3D animations and neon fog effects
- **Simplified 3-screen flow**:
  1. Welcome screen with animated background
  2. Chrome profile selection and import
  3. Flashlight animation completion

### 🔐 Enhanced Security Architecture
- **Touch ID integration** - Secure authentication during onboarding
- **Double-layer encryption** - Profile-specific encrypted storage
- **Keychain integration** - macOS Keychain for master password storage
- **Isolated profile data** - Each profile has its own encrypted store

### 🌐 Streamlined Chrome Import
- **Single browser support** - Focused on Chrome for better UX
- **Profile selection** - Users can choose which Chrome profile to import from
- **Smart data detection** - Automatically discovers available Chrome profiles
- **Progress tracking** - Visual feedback during import process

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### IPC Handler Architecture
- **Centralized onboarding handlers** - All onboarding IPC calls now properly registered
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support for all onboarding operations

### Storage System
- **Profile-specific encryption** - Each profile uses unique encryption keys
- **Persistent data recovery** - Seamless data restoration between app sessions
- **Secure password storage** - Passwords stored in encrypted profile stores

### Window Management
- **Transparent onboarding window** - Modern UI with vibrancy effects
- **Hidden title bar** - Clean, immersive interface
- **Proper modal behavior** - Prevents interaction with main window during onboarding

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes
- **IPC handler registration** - Fixed "No handler registered" errors for onboarding calls
- **Touch ID prompt** - Now properly appears during onboarding completion
- **Profile creation** - Fixed profile creation flow with proper error handling
- **Data persistence** - Ensured profile data survives app restarts

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Loading states** - Added proper loading indicators during operations
- **Error messages** - Clear, user-friendly error messages
- **Progress feedback** - Visual progress indicators for import operations

## 📁 Files Changed

### Core Onboarding
- `src/main/ipc/app/onboarding.ts` - Centralized IPC handlers
- `src/main/services/onboarding-service.ts` - Enhanced onboarding logic
- `src/main/browser/onboarding-window.ts` - 3D window configuration
- `src/renderer/src/hooks/useOnboarding.ts` - React hook improvements

### UI Components
- `src/renderer/src/pages/onboarding/OnboardingPage3D.tsx` - New 3D onboarding interface
- `src/renderer/src/components/onboarding/OnboardingModal.tsx` - Modal improvements
- `src/renderer/src/components/onboarding/OnboardingWindowPage.tsx` - Window page updates

### Storage & Security
- `src/main/store/desktop-store.ts` - Enhanced secure storage
- `src/main/services/profile-service.ts` - Profile management improvements
- `src/main/ipc/app/password-import.ts` - Chrome import functionality

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ First-time user onboarding flow
- ✅ Chrome profile detection and selection
- ✅ Password import from Chrome
- ✅ Touch ID authentication
- ✅ Profile data persistence
- ✅ Error handling scenarios
- ✅ Window transparency and vibrancy effects

### Automated Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ ESLint code quality checks
- ✅ IPC handler registration
- ✅ Storage encryption/decryption

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Encryption Layers
1. **System-level encryption** - Uses macOS safeStorage
2. **Profile-specific encryption** - Unique keys per profile
3. **Keychain storage** - Master password in macOS Keychain
4. **Touch ID authentication** - Biometric security

### Data Isolation
- Profile data is completely isolated between users
- Each profile has its own encrypted store
- No cross-profile data access possible

## 🚀 Performance Impact

### Optimizations
- **Lazy loading** - 3D components load only when needed
- **Efficient IPC** - Reduced IPC calls through centralized handlers
- **Memory management** - Proper cleanup of 3D resources
- **Background processing** - Import operations don't block UI

## 📋 Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- Existing profiles will be automatically detected and loaded
- No data loss during upgrade
- Touch ID will be prompted on first run after upgrade

### For Developers
- New onboarding components use React Three Fiber
- IPC handlers are now centralized in `onboarding.ts`
- Profile service API has been enhanced

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Support for additional browsers (Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Advanced profile customization options
- [ ] Cloud sync integration
- [ ] Enhanced 3D animations and effects

## 📝 Documentation

### Updated Documentation
